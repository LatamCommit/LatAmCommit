Welcome to this OpenSource project, the main goal is to practice our Git and GitHub skills in a simple static blog (meanwhile).

- Develop a static blog.
- Create team works

- Work from a environment 100% remote
- Reach professional experience like a real job.
- Gain knowledge about Open Source projects.
